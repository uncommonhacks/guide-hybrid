## Additional Comments

If at all possible, try to arrange your schoolwork and schedule so you
won’t have to be worrying about homework over the weekend. You’ll be
able to get the most out of the event, and hopefully will be
re-energized by taking a break from your schoolwork!

A week or so before Uncommon Hacks, you’ll get an invite to the Discord
server for the event. [Discord](https://discord.com) is a voice and messaging app
that will be the primary communication platform for the event.
You will use Discord to collaborate with other hackers,
join workshops and social activities, see announcements, and get help
from mentors and the Uncommon Hacks team.
Instructions on creating a free account (no payment required!)
and downloading the app will be sent
with the invitation to the event's server.

Additionally, we will live stream large events such as the opening and
closing ceremonies on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv) to make sure
everyone has the opportunity to watch.

# At the Event

## Staying Cool

In a hackathon environment, surrounded by people who hack away,
seemingly intensely focused, it is easy to feel intimidated. If it is
your first time at a hackathon, or your 100th time at a hackathon, you
may feel that everyone around you is more talented than you. That’s not
the environment we want to sustain. Chances are, the person next to you
may have had the same problem you had a week ago! Know that hackathons
are learning experiences for all.

![Cool](media/image1.png)

## Safeness

If ever at any point you should feel unsafe at the event,
PLEASE contact a team member through Discord, email
[celery@uncommonhacks.com](mailto:celery@uncommonhacks.com),
or contact the MLH representative. We will handle the situation accordingly.

## Getting Settled

Joining the Discord server will serve as your check-in for the event.
Before opening ceremonies and hacking begins on Saturday,
you can chat casually with other
hackers, meet sponsors, participate in activities to find a team, or just hang out.

We have a number of sponsors who provide support for this event.
You'll be able to join their Discord channels to talk with them about what
they do. Sponsors often come to recruit for jobs and internships, let
you know about their products for developers, and might sponsor a prize
or two.

### Forming a Team

You are encouraged to work in teams of up to four (4) people! 
Collaborating with hackers across different schools is especially welcome. 
We will offer plenty of opportunities for you to meet new people and make teams. 

Many people choose to work with teams at hackathons. Some people may
already have a team going into the event: from school, from being meme
friends online, etc. But do not worry if you do not have a team at the
event! We will have a team formation activity at the event for you to
find others to work with who have the same technological interests or
same meme interests as you.

More importantly, have no fear if you think you’re not good enough to
work on a team. There is always something for everyone to do on a
hackathon team, whether it be design, the front-end work, the back-end
work, connecting the circuits for the hardware device. Just make it
known that you are willing to work and to learn, and you should be
great.

It’s also totally fine to work on a project by yourself.

### Deciding on an idea

When you have a team, start thinking about what you might want to build.
You can build basically anything you want, with the main rule being you
have to build it entirely during Uncommon Hacks. We’ll have several
themed prizes, such as “Most Uncommon” (see the Devpost site for the
full list), which you might use as inspiration for your project. 
Our hackers created the most whimsical projects from 3D music visualizer to Pokémon cards producer.
You also can look at 
- [2021 submissions](https://uncommon-hacks-2021.devpost.com/project-gallery)
- [2020 submissions](https://uncommon-hacks-2020.devpost.com/project-gallery) 
for some examples of what kinds of projects people have worked on.

It can be hard to decide on an idea, especially if you’re working with
teammates you’ve just met. Have fun brainstorming, and you can approach
finding an idea from either the perspective of what you are interested
in, or what technologies you are interested in learning.

Don’t feel like your project has to be the next big thing or something
you’d use every day. **We encourage you to make something creative and
fun and possibly totally useless!** What *is* important is that you have
a good time building it and learn in the process.

## Opening Ceremonies

Once you’ve had some time to get settled, we’ll officially start the
event with the opening ceremonies. Some of our sponsors will give a short
presentation about what they do. You’ll also hear from our partner
[Major League Hacking](http://mlh.io), which helps organize over 200
student hackathons each year and provides organizational support. We’ll
also go over the basic rules for the event, and provide an overview of the next 24 hours!

## Working on your Project

After opening ceremonies, it’ll be time to jump in and get working!
You’ll have 24 hours to make your project.

### Starting your Project

Once you’ve settled on an idea and are ready to dive in, one of the first
barriers you might run into is setting up your environment and doing all
the
[yak-shaving](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YakShavingDefinedIllGetThatDoneAsSoonAsIShaveThisYak.aspx)
necessary to start writing code. This can seem difficult, and it can be
tricky to get everyone on your team on the same page, but it’s important
to do these first steps. Check out the Additional Resources section for
some getting started guides for different environments.

When you have a free moment, it’s also wise to draft your submission to
Devpost, which is the site
we use to track submissions. Everyone on your team should make an
account, and you can add multiple people to a project. Most other
hackathons also use Devpost for submissions, so you’ll be able to build
a portfolio with the projects you make!

### Asking for Help

There’ll be a point where you get stuck on something when working on
your project, whether it be a technical roadblock, a decision you don’t
have enough information to make, or a question about best practices. We
will have a few mentors during the event who will be around to answer
any technical questions, and there are also are probably other hackers
who might be familiar with what you are working with. Just send a
message to the *technical\_help* channel on Discord, and someone should
get back to you!

If you have a question about the event for the Uncommon Hacks team (such
as a scheduling question, a rule clarification, etc.), send a message to
the *questions* channel. There’s a good chance someone else has the same
question, and this lets anyone on our team respond. You can also message
any of the team members directly on Discord if necessary.

## Additional Events

At Uncommon Hacks, we’ll have numerous fun events, such as technical workshops
given by students and professionals, [Bob Ross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLWEXRAnQd0)
painting, sunrise yoga, and much more. These
workshops are meant to be fun learning experiences that serve as a break
from your project.

We want the other events to be a surprise… so you will not find out
until the day of ;).

## Food

We have scheduled breaks during meal times for folks in Chicago,
but you can grab grub at any time during the event.

## Sleeping

Hackathons have a reputation for uninterrupted work with little sleep,
but it’s important that you have the energy for the entire event and don’t
burn out. You *should* take some time to get a decent night’s sleep.

## Finishing your Project

When you’re almost done with your project, make sure to finalize your
submission on Devpost and click submit before the deadline (2 pm on
Sunday)! Devpost will be the way we look and submit projects,
so it is key that you register for a team otherwise your project will not be judged.
You can select which of the theme and sponsor prizes you want
your project to be reviewed for.

When time is up, you must stop hacking. However, you’re allowed to debug
and make small fixes to their programs if necessary.
For example, if you are demoing  your hack, and you find a bug that breaks
your application, and the
fix is only a few lines of code, it's fine to fix that.

## Demos and Presentations

### The Expo

After hacking has ended, we will assign
teams to virtual rooms for a science-fair style expo. We’ll use the Devpost
submissions to assign each group to a room and announce the
assignments when they are determined. Your team will be given a room
number, and there will be some time for judges and other participants to
move between rooms to see your projects. Even if your project isn’t fully
working or you didn’t finish it, you should still present! People like
hearing about what you tried to do, what challenges you faced, what
technology you used, and what you learned.

We will have a number of judges who will be going around and asking
about your projects. They will be using a judging system called
[Gavel](http://www.anishathalye.com/2016/09/19/gavel-an-expo-judging-system/)
(which was built by the HackMIT team) to rank the
projects. Using fancy math, Gravel aggregates all the judges’ responses
and determines a ranking, which is used to determine the top projects.
Themed prizes will be judged separately, and sponsor prizes will be
judged by the sponsors, respectively.

### Final Presentations and Awards

After the expo, we'll have some of the top projects present.
Then, we will give out awards. Following some closing remarks, the event will finish!

## Technical Resources

Once you have an idea for a project, you’re going to figure out how to build it.
Of course, Google is one of the best ways to figure out how to build your project.
For example, if you would like to build a website, you can google
“How to Build a Website” or “HTML/CSS/Javascript.”
Some great tutorials for beginning new topics are [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/),
[Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tutorialslibrary.htm) if you know exactly
what language you’re using, or [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/)
if you like learning with videos. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
is a fantastic resource for web development and browser extensions.
There are also many MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses) online. Once you know what stack
you will be using, you can dive in by researching tutorials online for what you’re building online.
Ensure that you are dividing up the work evenly within your team.
Our advice is to take it step by step - write one piece of code, see if it works,
then build on the next part. Debugging is annoying, so tread carefully!
